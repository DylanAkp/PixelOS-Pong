This repository is an index of the different projects related to the port of PixelOS on the Nothing Phone 2.

A custom ROM is a modified version of Android, the aim of which is to compile and adapt this modified version in order to be installed on different devices.

PixelOS is an AOSP based ROM, with Google apps
included and all Pixel goodies. We aim to provide
an experience similar to Google Pixel phones with
numerous performance enhancements and a small
amount of useful additional features.
